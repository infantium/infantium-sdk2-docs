Saved Games API
===============

Infantium provides cloud storage to save the progess of a player inside a content. Maybe
you want to save in wich scene the player left the game or some item the player has achieved
during gameplay.

Saved Games API is a cross platform API. It doesn't matter if your content is developed to be
run as an HTML5 page or as a native Android app. You only need to save your game data in
infantium and it will be persisted among different devices, allowing a player to start consuming
content on a device and switching to another without loosing progress.

All data must be transformed to a valid JSON format that is convenient for your content.
Data format that you choose when saving a progress JSON file must be conveniently known
beforehand. Infantium saved API also handles versioning the progress data allowing the
developer to write migration functions that allow progress to be updated if needed
when new content is avaliable trough content updates on IPC panel.


Migrating Saved Games
'''''''''''''''''''''

Writing a progress update is easy, you just only need to notify infantium SDK of your
version dependent migration fucntion and it will perform the migration if needed when
a player requires it.
